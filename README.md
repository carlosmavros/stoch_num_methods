## Lecture Notes - Stochastic Numerical Methods & Applications


This repository contains the lecture note for the class of Stochastic Numerical Methods and Applications.
This class is taught by Prof. Sotirios Sampanias @SEMFE-NTUA.

# Important
The lecture notes are typed during class as a .org (ORG-MODE) file.
Org Mode allows to export org files as pdf, .tex, .html etc..

The .tex file generated by org mode should be able to run using pdflatex without any issues
but some minor changes may be needed to compile on your machine.

Note that the .pdf file is exported directly from org-mode and not through the .tex file using pdflatex,
and this is the reason why the .tex may not work out of the box.

After each update of the notes, the full pdf file is provided.
